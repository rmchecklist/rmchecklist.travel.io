Django - Python web framework

How it works?
                               -->Template                                  
Http Reqquest --> URLS.py --> View.py --> HTTP response
                              <----> Models.py
                              
                              
URL.py --> All http request will direct to url.py and it is redirected to respective view.py

view --> Request handler function, receioved http request and returns http response, 
            it access the data needed to satisfy requests via models and delegate the formatting of the response to templates.
            
Model --> Model are python objects that define the structure of application data.
            
Templates --> it defines the structure or layout of the file.

Django refers Model View Template(MVT) which is similar to MVC architecture

Sending the request to the right view
--------------------------------------
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('book/<int:id>/', views.book_detail, name='book_detail'),
    path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls')),
    re_path(r'^([0-9]+)/$', views.best),
]

urlpatterns object is list of path/re_path functions

path(part of the url, function, will be called when the pattern is matched)

e,g views.book_detail --> Book detail can be found in views.py(inside file named views.py)


Handling the request(views.py)
------------------------------


view.py
